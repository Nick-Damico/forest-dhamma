# Forest Dhamma APP
  App to manage talks given by the international community of monks and nuns in the Thai Forest Tradition and the teachings of the late Ajahn Chah.

  Built as my final project at Flatiron School online developer bootcamp using Rails 5 in --api only mode and leveraging `ActiveModelSerializer` gem with a client side React and Redux front end. It allows a users to upload their favorite talks from Dhamma Teachers all over the world where they can be favorited, commented on, and tagged.
